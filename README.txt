Mesh Optimization and Partitioning
Repository Structure
This repository contains tools and implementations for mesh optimization, partitioning, and visualization in both 2D and 3D spaces. The codebase is organized into three primary directories as detailed below.
Piecewise Linear Mesh 2D
This directory contains implementations for 2D mesh optimization and bipartitioning:

2Doptimization.py: Algorithm for bipartitioning random 2D meshes
snake_optimization: Implementation of optimization and bipartitioning algorithms for arbitrary mesh structures
Pre-processed 2D mesh data stored in .npz format for immediate use

Piecewise Linear Mesh 3D
This directory houses modules for 3D mesh partitioning:

Multiple implementation files with various approaches to 3D mesh partitioning
Files with suffix CL contain custom contour loss functions designed for experimental purposes

L1-Poly-Data
This directory includes:

Comprehensive hexahedral mesh datasets for testing and validation

VisualizeMesh
This directory contains:

Optimized mesh configurations stored in .npz format
Associated f-values for each mesh
These files can be loaded and visualized at any time for analysis or demonstration

Usage
The mesh data and optimization results can be loaded and visualized using the provided modules. Please refer to individual module documentation for specific implementation details.
